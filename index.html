        <p>
          My persona is about a man named John Banner, who is a college athlete and struggles keeping up with all their assignments and 
          Practice. They need a better way to see all their assignments and when there due so they can make it to practice and games on time and 
          also not have to worry and about their grades. John said, "I need a better way to see my assignments on time", and our website does just that.

      <p>
        I choose to do my storyboard on John Hamilton. John has a game later on in the week on Friday but has not finished his assignments 
        for al his class. If he does not find his assignments and finish them on time, he will not be able to play in the game on Friday. 
        While scanning the internet he find our website, which will help him with his problem, and get all his work done in time. John is very 
        pleased with the website and tells his teacher about it. On Friday John is worry free and wins the game for his team.
